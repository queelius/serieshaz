Title: Series System Distributions from Dynamic Failure Rate Components
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Alexander", "Towell", , "lex@metafunctor.com",

Description: Compose multiple dynamic failure rate (DFR) distributions into
    series system distributions. A series system fails when any component
    fails, giving a system hazard equal to the sum of component hazards.
    The resulting object inherits from 'dfr_dist' so all existing methods
    (hazard, survival, CDF, density, sampling, MLE fitting) work
    automatically.
